# Consumer Complaints

## Description

###### This project was designed as a learning experience with pandas.  The goal was to read in a CSV file, pull out specific data, and summarize it.  It was also expected that the data be displayed with a graphical representation.  The following data was analyzed:

* Number of complaints by product
* Number of complaints by company(only displaying the top 10 companies)
* Number of complaints by company response
* Mean number of complaints by day of week

###### Observations were also made for each of those data sets.
